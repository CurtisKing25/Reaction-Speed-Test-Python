# Reaction-Speed-Test-Python
This is a reaction speed test I created using the time and random libraries.
I tried to make it accessible for people who don't know much about computers 
and it seemed to be received well by anyone I've shown it to, regardless of experience. 
I want to use reading and writing to and from a CSV file to make a leaderboard to encourage competiton
and maybe a comparision to scores based off gender and age so participants can see if they are 
above average, in line or below average for their category.

Edit:

I am now using MySQL to store the leaderboard
I will further this project by adding the following

The database sorts itself from lowest to highest after each new input
if the same username is already in the database it will overwrite their score if it is faster
the leaderboard will be easily viewable from the terminal so I don't have to show users phpMyAdmin
