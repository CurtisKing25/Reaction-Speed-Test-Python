# Reaction-Speed-Test-Python
This is a reaction speed test I created using the time and random libraries.
I tried to make it accessible for people who don't know much about computers 
and it seemed to be received well by anyone I've shown it to, regardless of experience. 
I want to use reading and writing to and from a CSV file to make a leaderboard to encourage competiton
and maybe a comparision to scores based off gender and age so participants can see if they are 
above average, in line or below average for their category.
